They were cynical, god-like beings that understood langauge, and spoke it very well. They were wise and greedy. Calm yet strong, and they ruled this world through fear. I mean, how could a man defeat someone, no someTHING, 10 times its height alone! The powers of a man are no match against the capabilities of a dragon... Still, someone did. There was a man who stood up and challenged the dragons. With a sword sharp as a tack and tougher than saying no to a night with a beautiful woman, his steel blade could cut through the scales of those winged vermin that so dared to breathe the same air as him."
